        <p>Adds an operator to put the current particle system’s particle locations into a point-cloud mesh object.
        Usage</p>
        <p>Have an object selected with a particle system on it, and be on a frame of the timeline during which there are ‘alive’ particles.</p>
        <p>Use the spacebar-menu and begin typing pcloud – that should get it with the first few letters.</p>
        <p>Note: the newly created object is not selected. This is not a bug.</p>
