# pcloud
[Blender Addon] Adds an operator to put the current particle system's particle locations into a point-cloud mesh object.

#Usage

Have an object selected with a particle system on it, and be on a frame of the timeline during which there are 'alive' particles.

Use the spacebar-menu and begin typing ``pcloud`` -- that should get it with the first few letters.

Note: the newly created object is not selected. This is not a bug.


####Wishlist:

* Accurate[!] trail particle conversion.  That was too difficult to get so I left it out.
